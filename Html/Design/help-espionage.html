<p>%("A temporary spy report contains the following information:<br />After a spy sneaks into a colony, he observes a part of specific events (completion of units, buildings, and education). He summarizes this information, so you can see how the buildings and education-levels changed since he sneaked in. Note that this information can differ substantially from the current situation depending on the age of the colony. In the long term spys are a very mighty weapon against enemies, as the spy accustoms himself and can therefore observe more events. Consequently his reports improve continuously.");</p>
